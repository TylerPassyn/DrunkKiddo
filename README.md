# DrunkKiddo
DrunkKiddo is an innovative project aimed at preventing drunk driving by using facial recognition technology. We have trained a machine learning model to detect if someone is drunk based on their facial features. The application notifies a parent or guardian if a scan indicates that the person is intoxicated.
